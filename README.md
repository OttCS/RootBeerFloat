# RootBeerFloat
A super weird (but small) audio format

It's a crazy amalgamation of custom 8-bit Floats and an approach similar to DSD to provide an extremely low bit depth audio format that can capture far more detail that just rounding to store samples as 0-255. Try it out by uploading your own audio files and listening to them by processing them. If you like it (for some reason, it probably doesn't sound nearly as good as it originally did) you can download the RBF file.

RootBeerFloat is the name because it uses Raw Byte Floats to represent the deltas, and that sounded close enough to Root Beer Float. I thought it was funny.
